a JavaScript tile map editor for 2d platform games.  Very much a work in progress :)

Currently only outputs maps for the collision layer.

Todo:
  Click and hold to paint tiles 
  Graphical tile layers above collision layer    
  Settings object for setting heights/widths of tiles, maps, etc.
  Upload sprite sheets dialog
  Output maps to JSON
  Pan map on right click
  Split demo into its own module
